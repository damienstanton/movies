{"name":"Movies","tagline":"React-Native Tutorial for iOS","body":"This repository contains the completed source code for [the official React Native tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial.html).\r\n\r\nIt's a toy movie-listing app that doesn't do anything other than fetch the top movies from Rotten Tomatoes.\r\n\r\n#### Usage\r\n\r\nMake sure Node and Xcode are reasonably up to date.\r\n\r\nYou should probably also be familiar with developing in ReactJS or one of its variants before playing with this.\r\n\r\nIn your terminal:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ngit clone https://github.com/damienstanton/movies && cd movies\r\nnpm install\r\nopen ireact.xcodeproj\r\n```\r\nThen, in Xcode:\r\n\r\n`⌘R`\r\n\r\nObserve that making changes to _index.ios.js_ and hitting `⌘R` results in live updating in the iOS simulator.\r\n\r\nIf you write in another language (something awesome, like [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript)) simply target your compiler at _index.ios.js_.\r\n\r\nShared under the `MIT LICENSE`\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
